# AIR workspace

AIR-owned code for the AIR local-first personal agent, built on a fork of an MIT-licensed upstream agent harness. The plan and its evidence live in [research/research.md](../research/research.md); the development guide is [research/notes/08-dev-contrib-guide.md](../research/notes/08-dev-contrib-guide.md).

New here? Start with [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md); coding agents start with [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Layout

```
air/
  pnpm-workspace.yaml     separate pnpm workspace (bundles/*, packages/*)
  bundles/air/            @air/dsh-air-bundle: product defaults as a Cordis patch
  packages/convention-core/          shared discovery library for the convention plugins
  packages/skill-conventions/        skill provider: .claude/skills, project skill roots, ~/.air/skills
  packages/instruction-conventions/  .claude/CLAUDE.md, @path imports, .claude/rules
  packages/mcp-conventions/          .mcp.json servers per Agent, with approval (/mcp)
  packages/command-conventions/      .claude/commands with $ARGUMENTS
  apps/                   AIR desktop app and its Host entry (plan 07; not built yet)
  plans/                  roadmap, implementation plans, and API spikes
  examples/               profile-patch examples, e.g. the local Ollama route
  UPSTREAM-DELTA.md       every file AIR changes outside air/ and research/
```

This directory sits outside the upstream workspace globs (`packages/*/*`, `apps/*`), so upstream's workspace constraints, coverage, and bilingual-documentation gates do not apply here. Two repository-wide text gates still scan it: `verify-concrete-terms` and `verify-repository-references`.

## Branches

- `master` mirrors upstream (`upstream` remote) and is fast-forwarded only at upstream release tags.
- `air/main` carries AIR work and merges `master` at each upstream release tag.

After each merge: `pnpm install`, `pnpm run build`, bump AIR peer ranges, run `pnpm dsh --profile air --dump-config` and check stderr for unmatched patch targets, boot once, run AIR tests.

## The `air` profile

```sh
pnpm dsh --profile air --from-default-profile web     # create the profile from the Web template
pnpm dsh plugin --profile air add "$PWD/air/bundles/air"
cp air/examples/ollama.profile.cordis.patch.yml ~/.dsh/profiles/air/cordis.patch.yml
echo 'OLLAMA_API_KEY=ollama' >> ~/.dsh/.env
pnpm dsh --profile air --dump-config                  # inspect the composed tree
pnpm dsh --profile air                                # boot the Web UI
```

The bundle disables the upstream rows that send data to, or depend on accounts with, the upstream vendor's services, and makes a local Ollama model the default. See [bundles/air/cordis.patch.yml](bundles/air/cordis.patch.yml).

## Toolchain

Run the root build first; AIR packages link to its `lib/` outputs.

```sh
pnpm install && pnpm run build        # repository root
pnpm -C air install                   # AIR workspace (pnpm 11.7.0, lockfile committed)
pnpm -C air run build                 # every AIR package
pnpm -C air run typecheck
pnpm -C air run lint                  # fails if air/.oxlintrc.json is stale; regenerate with lint:gen
pnpm -C air run test
pnpm -C air run smoke                 # isolated DSH_HOME: compose and boot the AIR bundle
```

New packages follow the templates in [plans/spikes/01-toolchain.md](plans/spikes/01-toolchain.md): `tsconfig.build.json` extends `../../tsconfig.base.json`, upstream packages are `link:` devDependencies with `^0.2.0-rc.1` peers, and each product-visible plugin has a native-resolution Loader test whose `cordis.yml` is written inside the package directory.

Upstream workflows under `.github/workflows/` also run on pushes to this fork; disable the ones that need upstream secrets in the fork's Actions settings.

## File conventions

New sessions use the `air` agent preset, a copy of the upstream `standard` preset with the convention plugins added (`bundles/air/cordis.patch.yml`). After every upstream merge, run `pnpm -C air exec vitest run scripts/tests/preset-air-drift.spec.ts`; a failure names the upstream row to re-copy into `preset-air`, and `pnpm -C air run check:composition` confirms the composed profile.

User-level folders written for other agents (`~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/commands`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) are not read by default, because a large unrelated skill catalog derails small local models. `~/.air/skills` and `~/.air/commands` are always read. To opt in, add to `$DSH_HOME/profiles/air/cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- id: air-command-conventions
  config:
    includeUserRoots: true
```

and copy the `preset-air` row from the bundle patch into the same file with `includeUserRoots: true` added to the `air-skill-conventions` and `air-instruction-conventions` configs (a patch replaces a row's whole `config`, so the full plugin list must be repeated).

Project MCP servers from `.mcp.json` start only after `/mcp approve <server>`; run it before the first message of a session. Approvals are stored in `$DSH_HOME/air/mcp-approvals.json`.

## Quality bar

AIR packages keep ESM-only modules, the package README template (Summary, Model Experience, Known Limitations), REAL-composition Loader tests for product-visible plugins, and 100% per-file coverage. They do not require Chinese translation pairs.
